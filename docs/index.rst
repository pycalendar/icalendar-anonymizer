What Gets Anonymized?
=====================

**Personal data** is hashed using SHA-256:

- Event summaries, descriptions, locations
- Attendee and organizer names
- Comments and categories

**Technical properties** are preserved for bug reproduction:

- Dates and times (DTSTART, DTEND, DUE)
- Recurrence rules (RRULE, RDATE, EXDATE)
- Metadata (STATUS, PRIORITY, SEQUENCE)
- Timezones (complete VTIMEZONE components)

See the :doc:`usage/python-api` for the complete property reference table.

Features
========

Deterministic hashing
    Same input + same salt = same output

Structure preservation
    Word count and email format stay intact

UID uniqueness
    UIDs remain unique across the calendar

Customizable
    Use ``preserve`` to keep specific properties

Secure by default
    Unknown properties get anonymized

Well tested
    High test coverage with parametrized tests

Comprehensive documentation
    "If it's not documented, it's broken."
